## Git Strategy

### Branches

All development should take place on the ***dev*** branch. When our project is in a stable state, we can merge ***dev*** into ***master***.

### Tags

Whenever the ***master*** branch reaches a good state with new features, that could be considered "the best candidate we currently have for professor submission", we can add a git tag.

We should use [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) to name our tags (aka releases). Long story short: vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
